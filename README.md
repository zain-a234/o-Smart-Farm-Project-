# o-Smart-Farm-Project-
Welcome to the Smart Farm Project repository! This project is a self-training initiative focused on developing an intelligent farming system using IoT sensors and machine learning technologies. The goal is to create a smart, efficient, and sustainable farming environment.

Key Features
IoT Sensor Integration: Real-time monitoring of soil conditions, including organic material levels and humidity.
Machine Learning Analysis: Algorithms that analyze sensor data to predict plant water and nutrient needs.
Automated Adjustments: Intelligent system that adjusts watering and fertilization schedules based on real-time data.
Resource Optimization: Continuous data collection and analysis to improve prediction accuracy and optimize the use of water and fertilizers.
Technologies Used
Sensors: For accurate measurement of soil conditions.
Machine Learning: For data analysis and predictive modeling.
This repository contains all the necessary code, documentation, and resources to understand and replicate the Smart Farm system. Feel free to explore, contribute, and improve this innovative approach to modern agriculture!
